# Introduction
This paper focuses on the development of BusRouter, a smart routing system designed for an intended reduction in costs to a tourist bus operator in Singapore. 
The application also offers a way to assist bus operators in planning their routes by generat-ing the best route based on their requirements. 
This entails applying Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm on each node that results in the formation of a distance dictionary which in turn is processed by Ant Colony Optimization or Held-Karp algorithm, depending on the number of destinations. 
The system optimizes routes based on three key criteria: The three criteria include length/distance, time and the minimum ERP that is required with an optional consideration of current traffic.
